## Page 1: Home Dashboard

- **Route:** `/`
- **Purpose:** Weekly subscription schedule and market insights at a glance. The entry point that answers "what's happening in 청약 this week?"

### Sections

#### 1.1 Hero / Featured Subscription

- Full-width card highlighting the most notable upcoming subscription
- Content: Apartment name, location, key dates, unit count, builder name
- Background: Subtle gradient overlay on `white` card
- CTA: "View Details" button linking to `/listings/[id]`

#### 1.2 This Week's Schedule Timeline

- Horizontal swipeable card carousel (mobile) / grid row (desktop)
- Each card: Apartment name, location summary, application date range, status chip
- Status chips use `success` for "접수중" (accepting), `warning` for "마감임박" (closing soon), `info` for "접수예정" (upcoming)
- Cards sorted by application start date ascending
- Empty state: "이번 주 예정된 청약이 없습니다" with link to full listing

#### 1.3 Market Insight Cards

- 2-column grid (mobile) / 3-column grid (desktop)
- Each card: Metric label, value, trend indicator (up/down arrow with percentage)
- Metrics: Average competition rate, total units this month, trending regions
- Background: `white` cards on `surface` page background

#### 1.4 National Top Trades (실거래가 TOP 5)

- Ranked row list of the top 5 recent apartment trades by deal amount (last 2 days)
- Each row: Rank (1–5, 1–3 brand accent / 4–5 muted), apartment name, region (시군구 + 동), supply area with pyeong (`85㎡ (34평)`), floor, deal date, deal amount (우측 강조)
- Header subline: "최근 2일 거래 · 거래금액 상위 · 출처: 국토교통부"
- Hidden entirely when the array is empty or the upstream request fails
- No link target yet (follow-up ticket once a detail/search page exists for real-estate trades)
- Size unit clarification: 청약 리스팅은 공급면적(`minSupplyArea`/`maxSupplyArea`)을 노출, 실거래는 전용면적(`exclusiveArea`) — 서로 다른 축이므로 라벨 혼동 주의

#### 1.5 Latest News Preview

- 3 most recent news articles as compact cards
- Each card: Category chip, title (2-line clamp), date
- "View All" link to `/news`

## Page 2: Subscription Listing

- **Route:** `/listings`
- **Purpose:** Filterable, searchable list of all apartment subscriptions. The primary browse experience for users exploring available 청약 opportunities.

### Sections

#### 2.1 Sticky Filter Bar

- **Position:** Sticky below header (desktop) or below status bar (mobile)
- **Style:** `white` background with ambient bottom shadow
- **Filters (bound to `/apt-sales` as of Phase 6):**

| Filter | Type | Options | Query key |
|---|---|---|---|
| Keyword (단지명) | Text + clear, 300ms debounce, ≤50 chars | Free text substring | `q` |
| Region (시/도) | Multi-select dropdown, 수도권/광역시/도 그룹 | 17 시/도 | `region` |
| Status | Multi-select chip | 접수예정, 접수중, 발표대기, 발표일, 청약완료 | `status` |
| Subscription type | Multi-select chip | 공공 (public), 민간 (private) | `type` |

- Multi-select chips prepend a `Check` icon when active (color-only rule)
- Active filter count badge on mobile filter icon
- "초기화" button clears every filter (status + type + region + keyword)

**Roadmap (backend-dependent, not implemented):**

| Filter | Blocker |
|---|---|
| District (구/군) | `regionCode` only granular to 시/도 |
| Supply type (특별/일반) | No query param; supply breakdown ships on detail endpoint only |
| Builder | No query param; `constructorName` exposed on items but not filterable |

#### 2.2 Sort Controls

- **Options:** Date (newest first, default), Date (oldest first), Popularity (view count)
- **Style:** Inline dropdown, right-aligned above results

#### 2.3 Subscription Cards

- **Layout:** Full-width stacked cards (mobile) / 2-column grid (desktop)
- **Card content:**
  - Apartment name (headline)
  - Location (시/도 + 구/군 + 동)
  - Schedule: Application period (start–end dates)
  - Status chip (접수중 / 접수예정 / 마감)
  - Builder name
  - Unit count and size range (e.g., "84㎡ ~ 114㎡")
- **Card style:** `white` background, `8px` radius, no borders (per design system)
- **Interactive state:** Background shifts to `surface` on hover/press

#### 2.4 Pagination

- Page-based navigation (not infinite scroll) for SEO
- Shows: Previous / page numbers / Next
- URL reflects current page: `/listings?page=2`
- 20 items per page

### Data Requirements

| Endpoint | Data |
|---|---|
| `GET /apt-sales` | Paginated subscription list (bound via orval-generated `useGetAptSalesList`) |
| **Query params (bound)** | `status[]`, `houseDetailType[]`, `regionCode[]`, `keyword`, `page`, `size` |
| **Query params (roadmap)** | `district` (구/군), `supply` (공급유형), `builder` — no backend support yet; UI omitted until API lands |

Region options come from the `ItemRegionCode` enum generated by orval —
no separate `/filters/*` endpoint. Any `/api/filters/regions` or
`/api/filters/builders` reference in older docs is obsolete.

### Mobile Layout

- Filter bar collapses to a single row with filter icon + active count badge
- Tapping filter icon opens full-screen filter sheet (bottom drawer)
- Cards are full-width, separated by 16px vertical spacing
- Sticky filter bar remains visible while scrolling

### Key Interactions

- Select filter → results update immediately (no submit button)
- Tap card → navigate to `/listings/[id]`
- Change page → scroll to top, URL updates
- Filter state persisted in URL query parameters for shareability

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 6 filter types work independently and in combination
- [ ] District dropdown updates when region changes
- [ ] URL reflects all active filters and current page
- [ ] Cards display all required fields with correct status chip colors
- [ ] Empty state shown when no subscriptions match filters

## Shared Data Patterns

### Status Mapping

| Korean | English Key | Color Token | Chip Label |
|---|---|---|---|
| 접수중 | `accepting` | `success-50` bg / `success-700` text | 접수중 |
| 접수예정 | `upcoming` | `info-50` bg / `info-700` text | 접수예정 |

| 청약완료 | `closed` | `neutral-100` bg / `neutral-500` text | 청약완료 |

### Date Formatting

- Absolute dates: `YYYY.MM.DD` format (e.g., `2026.04.15`)
- Relative dates (news): `N일 전`, `N주 전`, `N개월 전`
- Date ranges: `2026.04.15 ~ 2026.04.17`

### Image Handling

- All images use `placeholder.svg` as fallback
- Lazy loading for below-fold images
- WebP format preferred with JPEG fallback

### SEO Requirements

- Every page has a unique `<title>` and `<meta description>` via `buildPageMetadata()`
- Subscription detail: `{아파트명} 청약 일정 및 정보 | 청약닷컴`
- Coming-soon `/trades`: `실거래가 | 청약닷컴` (remains indexable to capture brand queries)
- Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags on all pages; default OG image rendered by `/og` edge route and overridable per page via `?title=`/`?subtitle=`
- Structured data (JSON-LD): site-wide `Organization` + `WebSite`; per-listing `RealEstateListing` + `BreadcrumbList` on detail pages. (SearchAction is held back until listings binds `?q=`.)
- GEO: `public/llms.txt` provides a citation-friendly summary for AI search engines
